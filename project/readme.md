## About

PECS stands for Picture Exchange Communication System.<br />
The PECS helps anyone with communication challenges, such as persons with Autism, communicate by exchanging pictures.<br />

PECS have different phases and The Online Binder is designed for use in the 4th Phase,<br />
where we are able to use an “I want” picture followed by a picture of the item being requested.<br />
Learn more about PECS from Pyramid Educational Consultants who developed the PECS -<br />

## Description

The Website Application is designed to allow the use of the Binder even without registering.<br />
The PECS available are the generic items available to everyone.<br />
Registration will allow users of the application to upload their own PECS and add PECS to a favourites tab.<br />

### PECS Strips ( Home / Index )
<img src="images/binder-index-parts.jpg" width="700px">

The Interface is designed to be simple and resemble a PECS Binder with the I Want Strip at the top and the available PECS at the bottom<br />
The available PECS are all sorted in seperate tabs by their tags. <br />
For easy accessibility, the Available PECS are shown as large as possible and only occupy one row, scrollable in Y-axis.<br />
The Website is optimal in a wide-screen mode, such as on a tablet or any mobile device in landscape mode, or computer.<br />

#### Audio Feedback
Clicking on each of the PECS will play the audio of the PECS description.<br />
In the First..Then Strip, clicking on each of the boxes in the Strip will read that Box's sentence structure.. <br />
i.e. Clicking the First Box will read "First,.." followed by the PECS description, if filled. <br />
Clicking on the Read icon which will read the whole sentence structure for both the I want and the First..Then strips.<br />

#### Strip Tabs

##### I Want Strip
<img src="images/binder-iwant.jpg" width="700px">
The I Want Strip can be used by the individual to request for an activity or item.<br />
The PECS can be chosen by scrolling through the PECS tab then clicking on one of the available PECS,<br />
The chosen PECS then will automatically appear beside the I Want Picture.<br />

##### First .. Then Strip
<img src="images/binder-first-then.jpg" width="700px">

The First .. Then strip is used to communicate with the individual and is useful to convey a sequence of events,<br />
i.e. First, an item or activity must be done, Then.. you can get the item or perform the next activity or task.<br />
The "First" Box is active by default (which can be recognized because of the black border), Choosing a PECS will fill the "First" Box.<br />
The active box will automatically move to "Then" after choosing a PECS, the next chosen pecs will fill up the "Then" Box.<br />

Clicking on any of the Boxes will change the active Box. Once an active box is chosen, you can change the current PECS by clicking another PECS.<br />
Alternately, the user can click the reset button to clear the Strip Boxes.

#### Upload
<img src="images/binder-upload.jpg" width="700px">
Upload allows a registred user to upload a PECS.<br />
The PECS will then appear with the rest of the Available PECS and will only be available to the person that uploaded the picture.<br />

<img src="images/binder-upload-success.jpg" width="700px">
Upon a successful upload, the PECS will be shown including the description and the tag.<br />

A database entry will be insderted containing the image's location, the description audio location, and the tag. <br />

#### Edit
<img src="images/binder-edit-tag.jpg" width="700px">
Edit allows the user to change the Description and Tag of the PECS, or delete the picture.<br />
Clicking on the Description will provide a cursor to allow the user to change the description.<br />
Clicking on the tag will show all available tags in a drop-down.<br />
The changes, once made are saved to the database automatically and will not need any additional action to save.<br />
Only the PECS that the user has uploaded will be shown in this section.<br />

#### Manage Faves
<img src="images/binder-manage_fave.jpg" width="700px">
PECS can be added to a favourite tab.<br />
All Available PECS, including the standard PECS will can be tagged in favourites.<br />
Clicking on an empty star will add the PECS to favourites,<br />
Clicking on a solid star will remove it from favourites.<br />

<img src="images/binder-home-fave.jpg" width="700px">
A Favourites tab will appear with all the PECS tagged as favourite.<br />
